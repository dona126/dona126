## Hi all ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„ 

I am Dona Maria Sunny.
Software Quality Engineer with hands-on experience in manual testing and focused training in automation. During this time, I have built a solid foundation in software testing practices and developed strong skills in designing and implementing test automation frameworks using Java, Selenium WebDriver, Rest Assured, TestNG, and Maven.

I am also learning data science to extend my QA capabilities into data-centric applications. Itâ€™s an area I am excited to grow in as more systems rely on data and intelligent models.

Key Skills:
1. Java, TestNG for test scripting and framework development
2. Selenium WebDriver for UI automation testing
3. Rest Assured for API testing
4. Maven, Git, and GitHub for build management and version control
5. Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions
6. Designing scalable and maintainable test automation frameworks
7. Python
8. SQL

With my combined experience in manual and automation testing, and a growing focus on data testing, I aim to deliver high-quality, efficient test coverage across both UI and data-driven systems.
